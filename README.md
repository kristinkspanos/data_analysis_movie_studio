# Movie Studio Analysis

## project goals
I analyzed a dataset of over 5000 films with the goal of developing insights on what elements contribute to a successful film and providing recommendations to a movie studio looking to update their strategy.

I tried to answer the following questions:
* Which lead and supporting actors tend to appear in movies with strong financial outcomes? Can I identify a list of actors with a track record of successful films for the studio to consider when planning future projects?
* Which directors direct the most financially successful films? Can I produce a list of directors with a history of strong financial outcomes for the studio to use when planning future projects?
* Which genres have the strongest financial outcomes - including the highest average profit and gross revenue, and the highest total profit and revenue? Which genres should the studio focus on in the future, and which genres should the studio de-emphasize?
* Which plot themes are associated with financial success? Which themes tend to be associated with unsuccessful movies? 

## recommendations
I analyzed the relationships between financial outcomes and several factors that the studio may consider when planning their films: lead actors, supporting actors, directors, genres, and plot themes.

* Lead and Supporting Actors
  * The analysis identified lead and supporting actors with a history of strong financial outcomes. These actors should be considered for future projects.
    * Top lead actors by average profit include:
    * Top supporting actors by average profit include:
    * Top lead actors by ROI include:
    * Top supporting actors by ROI include:
  * I also discovered that most of the top actors by profit and ROI are inexperienced (defined as appearing in fewer than 4 movies). The studio should collect and analyze data to try and identify the determinants of success for inexperienced actors. Potential data points include: experience acting in non-movie projects (such as TV shows, theatre productions, or comedy shows), and financial and popular success of non-movie projects.
* Directors
  * I identified directors with a history of strong financial outcomes. These directors should be considered for future projects.
    * Top directors by average profit include:
    * Top directors by ROI include: 
  * Similar to the results for actors, I also found that many top directors by average profit and ROI are inexperienced. The studio should look for opportunities to connect with up-and-coming directors, as well as identify the determinants of success for inexperienced directors. Potential data points include: experience directing non-movie projects (such as TV shows or music videos), experience working as a producer, writer, camera operator, or in another production-oriented role on a movie or non-movie projects. 
* Genres - focus on growth in two categories:
  *	Blockbusters
    *	high margin, low volume
    *	genres: Action, Adventure, and Fantasy movies
  *	Crowd-pleasers
    * low margin, high volume	 
    *	genres: Romance, Comedy, Animation, and Family movies
 * Plot keywords - I identified the plot keywords with the highest average gross revenue and profit, as well as the keywords that are unprofitable, on average. The studio should aim to develop films that follow one or more of these plot themes.
   * Movies with the plot keywords 'sequel', 'battle', 'spy', 'alien', and 'island' are the highest grossing, on average.
   * Movies with the plot keywords 'wedding', 'island', 'high school', 'female nudity', and 'hospital' are the most profitable, on average.
   * Movies with the plot keywords 'small town', 'writer', 'escape', 'scientist', 'boy', 'future', and 'box office flop' are not profitable, on average.
